After another great year of [Google Summer of Code 2012](/gsoc2012) and another [15 (+1) successful student projects](gsoc2012/slots), The Honeynet Project and students world-wide have been eagerly waiting to hear if Google would decide to run [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) again in 2013. Well the good news is that [Google officially announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/02/flip-bits-not-burgers-google-summer-of.html) that [Google Summer of Code 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) would definitely be happening. Go Google!

- We really enjoyed our experience as a successful mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code 2009](/gsoc2009), [Google Summer of Code 2010](/gsoc2010), [Google Summer of Code 2011](/gsoc2011) and [Google Summer of Code 2012](/gsoc2012). After a nervous few days of waiting, Google [officially announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/04/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html) the list of 177 accepted [GSoC 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) mentoring organizations on Monday April 8th at 19:00 UTC. The Honeynet Project is very pleased to announce that we have [once again been accepted as a mentoring organization](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/honeynet) for [GSoC 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013). Great news :-)
- Potential GSoC students and other interested parties view our still under development list of possible [project ideas](/gsoc2013/ideas) and potential mentors. As in previous years, this list of proposed [project ideas](/gsoc2013/ideas) is not definitive and will remain a work in progress until GSoC 2013 student applications officially start on April 22nd. We are also still open to receiving and mentoring interesting and novel project ideas received from students, including informal contact before official student applications begin. We will also probably post a public survey link here and on our main blog to allow anyone interested to suggest project ideas too. So if there is a research topic you are interested in working on this summer, please suggest it, or get in touch to discuss it further.
- The third and fourth milestones GSoC 2013 milestones (after Org application and selection) will be student applications and acceptance. GSoC 2013 student applications begins on [April 22nd](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) at 19:00 UTC and closed on [May 3rd](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) at 19:00 UTC. These dates are roughly a month later than in previous years, meaning that the [GSoC 2013 timeline](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) looks quite different to previous years, so please make sure you check the [timeline](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) carefully.
- To avoid disappointment and missed deadlines, if you are a student applying to GSoC this year, please make sure you submit your student application well in advance and don't leave it to the last minute! A good idea is to begin talking to us as soon as Google announces the official list of GSoC 2013 mentoring orgs (ie from April 9th). The sooner is usually the better.
- On Monday May 27th Google will officially announce the list of approximate 1000 lucky students who will be accepted to participate in [GSoC 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013). We very much hope that many of you reading this page will be amongst that number and about to start working for the summer on another exciting InfoSec project with The Honeynet Project.

### Contacting Us

 

If you have any questions, please drop by in our **#gsoc-honeynet** IRC channel on **irc.freenode.net** and say "hi" (note you may need to idle there for a few hours before you get an answer to a specific question, as our members do have to sleep and come from timezones all over the world, so please be patient and wait a few hours before chasing a response).

 

We still have our public mailing list for interested prospective GSoC students to get in touch and discuss project ideas for GSoC with the Honeynet Project - see [https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc ) for details. Please sign up if you have any questions about getting involved with the Honeynet Project in GSoC 2013.

 

### Organisational Administrators

Our GSoC 2013 organisational administrators this year are:

- David Watson (lead, UK)
- Lukas Rist (DE) Tan Kean Siong (MY)
- Mario Karuza (HR)
- Jeff Nathan (US)

So with the US, Europe and Asia covered we can hopefully offer students and mentors round the clock support again this year!

### Background Information

You can find a copies of recent presentations by our Chief Research Officer David Watson on our achievements during [GSoC 2009 to GSoC 2012](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/20120618_Honeynet_Project_David_Watson_RandD_Overview.pdf) or [GSoC 2009 and GSoC 2010](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/GSoC-2009-2010_Honeynet_Project_David_Watson.pdf), which hopefully provide a good introduction to the Honeynet Project and our collective activities from recent GSoCs. You can also read/watch David's presentations from two of our recent annual workshops in the [San Francisco Bay Area](SecurityWorkshops/2012_SF_Bay_Area/Mar_19/Workshop_Program_Agenda#David_Watson) (2012) or [Paris](/SecurityWorkshops/2011_Paris/Session1_2-R%2526D) (2011) too.

### Why get involved with the Honeynet Project?

- We are an enthusiastic and passionate group of volunteers dedicated to the ideals of open source and sharing our security research and development knowledge with the community
- For over ten years, we have pioneered research in the field of honeypots, releasing many freely available [tools](/project "tools"), [challenges](/challenges "challenges") and [Know Your Enemy whitepapers](/papers "kye") that are often considered groundbreaking when first published
- We literally wrote the [book](http://old.honeynet.org/book "book") on the topic, and regularly [present](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/PacSec07_David_Watson_Global_Distributed_Honeynet.pdf "pacsec") on our R&D activities at conferences all over the world
- We have [active](/node/371 "workshop") volunteer member [chapters](/og "chapters") in many countries and from many different backgrounds, with a wide variety of skills and experience they are happy to share
- We have always been committed to the concepts of open source software and freely share everything we do, including each chapter publishing regular public [status reports](/chapter/statusreports "status reports") on their recent activity
- We maintain active public and private communities of developers and researchers who use and contribute to our tools each day (for public examples, see our [projects page](https://projects.honeynet.org/) and [public mailing lists](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo)).
- We provide our members and the community with the public and private infrastructure necessary to support distributed collaborative remote working, such as IRC channels, mailing lists, subversion repositories, Trac instances for ticket management and wikis, content management systems, blogs, live deployments with real end users for testing and regular feedback, etc
- We are hands on, supportive and keen to involve more talented people in projects we are really passionate about
- We have a strong track history of mentoring new members and successfully delivering open source projects, tools and research that demonstrably benefit the community
- All of our GSoC 2009, 2011 and 2012 projects and all but one of our GSoC 2010 projects weredelivered successfully and our students were happy, with a number of the tools created going on to become widely used within the security community
- Students from GSoC 2009, GSoC 2010, GSoC 2011 and GSoC 2012 have gone on to become active members of the honeynet community, including proposing project ideas for GSoC 2010, GSoC 2011 and GSoC 2012 or offering to be project mentors and org administrators (so we can't be too unpleasant a bunch to get involved with!) ;-)
- Honeypots and honeynet technology, research and tools have filtered down benefits to many areas of IT, web development, operational service management, Internet education and computer security research

 

[GSoC](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) is not the only way you can become involved in the with honeynet technologies and open source software - check out our [current](/challenges) or [historic](http://old.honeynet.org/misc/chall.html) series of [forensic challenges](/challenges). Or learn more about the practical, real world application of honeynet technology in our popular series of ["Know Your Enemy"](/papers) whitepapers, which now include projects and tools output from previous GSoCs students or mentors such as [PicViz](node/499), [Glastopf](/papers/KYT_glastopf), [Qebek](/papers/KYT_qebek) or [Conficker](/papers/conficker).
