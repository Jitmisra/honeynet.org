Having really enjoyed our experience as a successful mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code 2009](/gsoc2009), The Honeynet Project is very pleased to have been accepted again this year as a potential mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2010](http://socghop.appspot.com). Sixteen students for thirteen projects have been accepted from the many [GSoC 2010 project ideas](/gsoc2010/ideas). You can check out the accepted projects and their status [here](/gsoc/acceptedprojects2010). The final tar balls with project code/readme are available [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2010-honeynet-project/downloads/list), but we encourage you to take a look at the accepted projects page for links to the latest files. GSoc is not the only way one can become involved in the with honeynet technologies and open source software - check out our [current](/challenges) or [historic](http://old.honeynet.org/misc/chall.html) series of [forensic challenges](/challenges). Or learn more about the practical, real world application of honeynet technology in our popular series of ["Know Your Enemy"](/papers) whitepapers, which now include projects and tools output from previous GSoCs students such as [PicViz](node/499) or [Conficker](/papers/conficker).

## Why get involved with the Honeynet Project?

- We are an enthusiastic and passionate group of volunteers dedicated to the ideals of open source and sharing our security research and development knowledge with the community
- For over ten years, we have pioneered research in the field of honeypots, releasing many freely available [tools](/project "tools"), [challenges](/challenges "challenges") and [Know Your Enemy whitepapers](/papers "kye") that are often considered groundbreaking when first published
- We literally wrote the [book](http://old.honeynet.org/book "book") on the topic, and regularly [present](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/PacSec07_David_Watson_Global_Distributed_Honeynet.pdf "pacsec") on our R&D activities at conferences all over the world
- We have [active](/node/371 "workshop") volunteer member [chapters](/og "chapters") in many countries and from many different backgrounds, with a wide variety of skills and experience they are happy to share
- We have always been committed to the concepts of open source software and freely share everything we do, including each chapter publishing regular public [status reports](/chapter/statusreports "status reports") on their recent activity
- We maintain active public and private communities of developers and researchers who use and contribute to our tools each day (for public examples, see our [projects page](https://projects.honeynet.org/) and [public mailing lists](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo)).
- We provide our members and the community with the public and private infrastructure necessary to support distributed collaborative remote working, such as IRC channels, mailing lists, subversion repositories, Trac instances for ticket management and wikis, content management systems, blogs, live deployments with real end users for testing and regular feedback, etc
- We are hands on, supportive and keen to involve more talented people in projects we are really passionate about
- We have a strong track history of mentoring new members and successfully delivering open source projects, tools and research that demonstrably benefit the community.
- All of our GSoC 2009 projects were delivered successfully and our students were happy, with a number of the tools created going on to become widely used within the security community
- Students from GSoC 2009 have gone on to become active members of the honeynet community, including proposing project ideas for GSoC 2010 or offering to be project mentors (so we can't be too unpleasant a bunch to get involved with!) ;-)
- Honeypots and honeynet technology, research and tools have filtered down benefits to many areas of IT, web development, operational service management, Internet education and computer security research
