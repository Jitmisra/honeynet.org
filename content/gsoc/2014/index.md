After another great year of [Google Summer of Code 2013](/gsoc2013) and another [14 successful student projects](gsoc2013/slots), The Honeynet Project and students world-wide were eagerly waiting to hear if Google would decide to run [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) again. 2014 marks a special milestone as the 10th year of GSoC, so Google broke from tradition and announced the GSoC 2014 program dates in early October, before the [GSoC 2013 Mentors Summit](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/11/google-summer-of-code-mentor-summit-2013.html) (which our members once again enjoyed attending and contributing to). Hopefully the past decade of GSoC success means great things for open source, interested students and the Honeynet Project once again this summer!

- The GSoC 2014 programme starts about a month earlier than usual, with the [first major milestone](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) being the deadline for [Mentoring Organization applications](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2014/02/mentoring-organization-applications-now.html) by [19:00 UTC on Friday February 14th](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014).
- We really enjoyed our experience as a successful mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code 2009](/gsoc2009), [Google Summer of Code 2010](/gsoc2010), [Google Summer of Code 2011](/gsoc2011), [Google Summer of Code 2012](/gsoc2012) and [Google Summer of Code 2013](/gsoc2012) so we are very happy to announce that we have once again applied to participate as a mentoring organization in GSoC 2014.
- Google will be reviewing Org applications over the coming days then announcing the official list of participating mentoring Orgs for GSoC 2014 on their [official blog](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/) on [19:00 UTC on Monday February 24th](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014). Usually 300-500 potential mentoring organizations apply, with only 150-200 lucky Orgs being selected. In the mean time, potential mentoring orgs will be improving their project ideas, preparing mentors, fielding student questions and keeping their fingers crossed in the hope of being selected.
- Potential GSoC students and other interested parties view our still under development list of possible [project ideas](/gsoc2014/ideas) and potential mentors. As in previous years, this list of proposed [project ideas](/gsoc2014/ideas) is not definitive and (assuming we get selected to participate) will remain a work in progress until GSoC 2014 student applications officially start on [March 10th](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014). We are also still open to receiving and mentoring interesting and novel project ideas received from students, including informal contact before official student applications begin. We will also probably post a public survey link here and on our main blog to allow anyone interested to suggest project ideas too. So if there is a research topic you are interested in working on this summer, please suggest it, or get in touch to discuss it further.
- The third and fourth milestones GSoC 2014 milestones (after Org application and Org selection) will be student applications and acceptance. GSoC 2014 student applications begins on [March 10th](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) at 19:00 UTC and closed on [March 21st](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) at 19:00 UTC. These dates are over a month earlier than last year, meaning that the [GSoC 2014 timeline](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) looks quite different to previous years, so please make sure you check the [official GSoC 2014 timeline](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) carefully if you plan on applying.
- To avoid disappointment and missed deadlines, if you are a student applying to GSoC this year, please make sure you submit your student application well in advance and don't leave it to the last minute! A good idea is to begin talking to us as soon as Google announces the official list of GSoC 2014 mentoring orgs (ie from February 24th). The sooner is usually the better, although since GSoC is highly competitive for both students and Orgs, we obviously cannot guarantee we will be selected to participate this year. Please bear that in mind when making contact.
- On [April 21st](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014) Google will officially announce the list of approximately 1000 lucky students who will be accepted to participate in [GSoC 2014](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014). We very much hope that many of you reading this page will be amongst that number and about to start working for the summer on another exciting information security project with The Honeynet Project.

## Project Ideas Past and Present

You can find our in progress GSoC 2014 ideas page here:

\* [GSoC 2013 Weekly Student Blogs](http://gsoc2013.honeynet.org/)

You could also watch previous students Sebastien Popleau present on his [Ghost USB Honeypot](http://www.youtu.be/o67spa_jAko), Claudio Guarnieri present on [Cuckoo sandbox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq8a7watLNU) or Maximilian Hills talk on using his [HoneyProxy for man-in-the-middle traffic analysis](http://prezi.com/rh6o1hhkpapc/honeyproxy-honeynet-workshop-dubai-2013/) at recent public workshops.

## Contacting Us

If you have any questions, please drop by in our **#gsoc-honeynet** IRC channel on **irc.freenode.net** and say "hi" (note you may need to idle there for a few hours before you get an answer to a specific question, as our members do have to sleep and come from timezones all over the world, so please be patient and wait a few hours before chasing a response).

We still have our public mailing list for interested prospective GSoC students to get in touch and discuss project ideas for GSoC with the Honeynet Project - see [https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc ) for details. Please sign up if you have any questions about getting involved with the Honeynet Project in GSoC 2014.

## Organisational Administrators

Our GSoC 2014 organisational administrators this year are:

- David Watson (lead, UK)
- Lukas Rist (DE)
- Tan Kean Siong (MY)
- Sjur Usken (NO)
- Felix Leder (DE/NO)

## Why get involved with the Honeynet Project?

- We are an enthusiastic and passionate group of volunteers dedicated to the ideals of open source and sharing our security research and development knowledge with the community
- For over ten years, we have pioneered research in the field of honeypots, releasing many freely available [tools](/project "tools"), [challenges](/challenges "challenges") and [Know Your Enemy whitepapers](/papers "kye") that are often considered groundbreaking when first published
- We literally wrote the [book](http://old.honeynet.org/book "book") on the topic, and regularly [present](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/PacSec07_David_Watson_Global_Distributed_Honeynet.pdf "pacsec") on our R&D activities at conferences all over the world
- We have [active](/node/371 "workshop") volunteer member [chapters](/og "chapters") in many countries and from many different backgrounds, with a wide variety of skills and experience they are happy to share
- We have always been committed to the concepts of open source software and freely share everything we do, including each chapter publishing regular public [status reports](/chapter/statusreports "status reports") on their recent activity
- We maintain active public and private communities of developers and researchers who use and contribute to our tools each day (for public examples, see our [projects page](https://projects.honeynet.org/) and [public mailing lists](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo)).
- We provide our members and the community with the public and private infrastructure necessary to support distributed collaborative remote working, such as IRC channels, mailing lists, subversion repositories, Trac instances for ticket management and wikis, content management systems, blogs, live deployments with real end users for testing and regular feedback, etc
- We are hands on, supportive and keen to involve more talented people in projects we are really passionate about
- We have a strong track history of mentoring new members and successfully delivering open source projects, tools and research that demonstrably benefit the community
- All of our GSoC 2009, 2011 and 2012 projects and all but one of our GSoC 2010 and GSoC 2013 projects were delivered successfully and our students were happy, with a number of the tools created going on to become widely used within the security community
- Students from GSoC 2009, GSoC 2010, GSoC 2011, GSoC 2012 and GSoC 2013 have gone on to become active members of the honeynet community, including proposing project ideas for GSoC 2010, GSoC 2011, GSoC 2012 and GSoC 2013 or offering to be project mentors and org administrators (so we can't be too unpleasant a bunch to get involved with!) ;-)
- We have ex-GSoC students standing for our Board of Directors and Executive Officer positions, so GSoC has definitely proven to be a great career path for students wanting to get more involved in open source and information security R&D.
- Honeypots and honeynet technology, research and tools have filtered down benefits to many areas of IT, web development, operational service management, Internet education and computer security research

[GSoC](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) is not the only way you can become involved in the with honeynet technologies and open source software - check out our [current](/challenges) or [historic](http://old.honeynet.org/misc/chall.html) series of [forensic challenges](/challenges). Or learn more about the practical, real world application of honeynet technology in our popular series of ["Know Your Enemy"](/papers) whitepapers, which now include projects and tools output from previous GSoCs students or mentors such as [PicViz](node/499), [Glastopf](/papers/KYT_glastopf), [Qebek](/papers/KYT_qebek) or [Conficker](/papers/conficker).
