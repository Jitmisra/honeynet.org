APKinspector is a static analysis platform for android applications. Think of it as IDAPro for android applications. The video at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X538N-x3UUY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X538N-x3UUY) nicely illustrates APKInspector's capabilities. APKInspector was developed by Cong Zhen as part of GSoc 2011. You can try it out by downloading Android Reverse Engineering virtual machine, which bundels APKinspector as well as additional android malware analysis tools.
