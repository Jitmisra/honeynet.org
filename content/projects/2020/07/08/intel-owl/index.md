[Intel Owl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl) is an Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT solution to get threat intelligence data about a specific file, an IP or a domain from a single API at scale. It integrates a number of analyzers available online and is for everyone who needs a single point to query for info about a specific file or observable.

We suggest you to try the application! It’s easy and fast, just [follow the step-by-step instructions](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) and, in a few minutes, you can get it running on your machine.

We are continuously working on under-the-hood improvements and optimizations and always looking for more contributors and feedback.
