The All In One Honeypot Platform.

T-POT is a honeypot system that is easy to deploy, has low maintenance and combines some of the best honeypot technologies in one system

T-POT is based on well-established honeypot daemons, IDS and tools for attack submission.  
The idea behind T-Pot is to create a system, whose entire TCP network range as well as some important UDP services act as honeypot, and to forward all incoming attack traffic to the best suited honeypot daemons in order to respond and process it.
