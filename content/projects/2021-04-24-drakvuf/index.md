DRAKVUF™ is a virtualization based agentless black-box binary analysis system. DRAKVUF™ allows for in-depth execution tracing of arbitrary binaries (including operating systems), all without having to install any special software within the virtual machine used for analysis.

DRAKVUF™ was designed to be nearly undetectable from within the VM, thus it provides an excellent foundation for building malware analysis and honeypot solutions.

Check the project on [https://drakvuf.com](https://drakvuf.com)

The DRAKVUF Sandbox project is a fully-featured automated malware analysis system built on top of DRAKVUF™. You can find it at [https://github.com/CERT-Polska/drakvuf-sandbox](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/drakvuf-sandbox)
