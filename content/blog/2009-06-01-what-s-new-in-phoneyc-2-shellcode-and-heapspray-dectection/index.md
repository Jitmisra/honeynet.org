Hi folks:

  

      I have done some basic shellcode and heapspray detection codes in the phoneyc's 'honeyjs' javascript engine (based on python-spidermonkey, with extra tracing and auditing works). And also I have made a presentation on the local honeynet chinese chapter last weeked. Details about my current approaches can be found on this slide: [http://is.gd/J9QP](http://is.gd/J9QP)
